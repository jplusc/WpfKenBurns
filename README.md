A simple, no-nonsense image screensaver for Windows inspired by macOS's Ken Burns screensaver.

## Features
* Highly configurable
* Images can be sourced from many different folders
* Supports high DPI monitors and scaling
* Supports monitor hotplugging (useful for DisplayPort monitors)
* Program denylist to prevent the screensaver from running when certain programs are open

## Installing
Get [the latest build (usually stable)](https://nightly.link/nicoco007/WpfKenBurns/workflows/build/main/WpfKenBurns.zip) and copy it into `C:\Windows\System32` (32-bit and 64-bit systems) or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64` (64-bit systems only) to install it system-wide. You will need to install the [.NET Desktop Runtime 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) if you do not already have it.
